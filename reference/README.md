Please try to solve the following 3 problems in this JavaScript playground. 

1. render a 8x8 grid of alternating colored squares in white and black with size of each square being 60px by 60px

2. add a button to invert the color of each square (black -> white, white -> black)

3. highlight selected row & column of the clicked square


* Vanilla JavaScript is preferred but you can use any library/framework.
